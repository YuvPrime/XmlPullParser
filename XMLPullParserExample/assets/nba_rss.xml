				Ten Before Tip: NBA news from Friday]]>

			</link>
<description>? The Knicks will be without forward Andrea Bargnani, who is out indefinitely after tearing the ulnar collateral ligament in his left elbow during the Knicks' 110-106 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday. It is yet another blow to the frontcourt depth of the Knicks, who are already without Amar'e Stoudemire and Kenyon Martin. Both are out with sprained left ankles. "It gives the young guys an opportunity to play," Woodson said before tipoff. "Cole Aldrich and Jeremy Tyler are two guys that haven't played much, but through the development program and us working with them, we're kinda anxious to see where they are as players."</description>
